    <h1>My Personal Website</h1>
    <p>My name is <strong>Jane Doe</strong>. I am a programmer. I make the computer <strong>beep boop beep</strong>.</p>

With all the skills I have learned in my programming career, I have decided to share my work and lifestyle with the world! I have coined the term <strong>technical influencer</strong> to best describe myself.</p>
